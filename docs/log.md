10/29:

bring it to parity with work so far:

9am

remove small amount of boilerplate from the default install

add react-router @types/react-router 

    npm install -D react-router @types/react-router

oops, i want dom

    npm install -D react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom

add redux ...

    npm install -D redux react-redux @types/react-redux


930am

add redux and types for the basic orgs

needed workaround for reducer not typematching (:any -- need to fix)

10:30am

working on table

adding oxygen font

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2872

npm install -D typeface-oxygen

10/30

8:30am

well, slipped on documenting the rest of the day

quick meeting w/ paramvir and shane, they basically okayed the 3-layered approach - orgs, members, narratives.
want to impl each mvp in about 3 days.

shane is quick to add (and has several times) that there is missing stuff which we can add later, or that some design decisions can be addressed later. I have my doubts, and also the wisdom of not going forward with changes we know we want now. Just generally worried about the engineering driven design!!!

added searching and more navigation

began editor, working on that this morning (new, but edit should be very similar)

8:45am

adding marked for markdown formatting.

10/31

halloween!
